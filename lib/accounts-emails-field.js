// GitHub
// If you register WITHOUT verifying the email you get
// "email": null
// on login, if then set the NON-verified email address as public you get it on
// login!
// So, GitHub provided email address cannot be considered as verified!!!

// Linkedin
// It doesn't permit to activate your account unless the email
// ownership is confirmed! even if, if you come back later you can access it...
// In any case 3r-party login is not permitted!!
